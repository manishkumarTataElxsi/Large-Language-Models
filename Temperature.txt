 **Temperature** is a parameter that controls the randomness of the output. 
It determines how likely the model is to select less probable tokens when generating text. 
The value of the temperature parameter affects the balance between creativity and predictability in the model's responses.

How It Works:
The temperature modifies the probability distribution over possible next tokens.
Lower temperatures (closer to 0) make the distribution sharper, favoring the most likely token. This results in more deterministic and focused outputs.
Higher temperatures (>1) make the distribution flatter, increasing the likelihood of selecting less probable tokens. This results in more diverse and creative outputs.
Effects of Different Temperature Values:
Low Temperature (e.g., 0.1)

The output becomes highly deterministic.
The model is less likely to explore alternative completions.
Useful for tasks requiring precision, such as factual answers or code generation.
High Temperature (e.g., 1.5)

The output becomes more varied and unpredictable.
The model is more likely to introduce creativity or unexpected responses.
Suitable for tasks like creative writing or brainstorming.
Moderate Temperature (e.g., 0.7)

Balances between randomness and focus.
Often used as a default for a mix of coherence and diversity.
Practical Use Cases:
Low Temperature: Generating step-by-step instructions, answering questions, writing formal documents, or generating code.
High Temperature: Writing poetry, generating ideas, or exploring novel and creative outputs.
Tuning: Adjusting the temperature based on the specific needs of the task to either focus the model or encourage more variety.
